Hello future self/the possible handful of people who may ever read this...
This is my first oding project titeld recipes...
I think there's gonna be some sort of cooking/coding anaology involved here
but I'm not entirely sure as I've yet to get to the end of this section but am 
following along. It's telling me (Odin, not the voices in my head ;)) to detail
this project and the skills I will have demonstrated (PATIENCE) once I complete
it. I would imagine discipline may be one as im self teaching coding here,
patience, problem solving, perseverance, time management, but mostly
patience and determination I would say. Maybe some aesthetic design work
or perhaps a new dinner recipe but again, not sure where this assignment is going.
